### 🔹 AISeeYou – AI-Powered X-Ray Object Detection (2025)

**Overview**  
AISeeYou is an AI-powered application designed to detect suspicious objects from X-ray scans quickly and accurately. It aims to enhance security screening by automating the identification of hazardous items such as knives, scissors, and Swiss Army knives using computer vision models.

**Problem**  
Manual interpretation of X-ray images is time-consuming and prone to human error. AISeeYou addresses this by leveraging object detection models to improve accuracy and speed in security inspections at airports, buildings, and public venues.

**Solution Highlights**
- Trained YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN models on Kaggle X-ray baggage dataset
- Visualized label distribution (Swiss Army Knife = 23.1%, Unidentified Object = 22.5%)
- Deployed real-time detection app with **Streamlit** on **Hugging Face Spaces**
- Achieved >80% **mAP@0.5** using Ultralytics evaluation tools

**Technologies**  
Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, Streamlit, TensorFlow, Hugging Face

**Future Work**  
Enhancing dataset diversity, applying data augmentation, model fine-tuning, and exploring other architectures like EfficientDet.
